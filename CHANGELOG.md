## Release Notes

### Version 0.0.0 - Initial Release

This initial release provides the core functionality for converting EDN configurations to PM2 ecosystem files. It includes:

- **Core API**: Programmatic access to all functionality
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for automation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Testing**: Extensive test coverage

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **EDN First**: Chose EDN for its readability and expressiveness
2. **TypeScript**: Ensured type safety and better developer experience
3. **Functional Programming**: Used pure functions for predictability
4. **Path Awareness**: Intelligent path resolution for different deployment scenarios
5. **Extensibility**: Designed architecture for future enhancements

#### Known Limitations

- Large file processing may require increased memory limits
- Path resolution assumes output directory as base
- Limited to EDN format (future versions will support more)
- No built-in configuration validation (planned for v0.1.0)

#### Migration Guide

Since this is the initial release, no migration is needed. Future versions will include migration guides for breaking changes.
